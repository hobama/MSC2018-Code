#### Folder structure
* global - Global AWS resources
* cowrie - Regional AWS resources
* generated - Auto-generated content from the scripts in bin/
* payload - The contents of this folder are uploaded to each EC2 instance by terraform. Contains config files, recipes for configuring the honeypot etc.
* bin - Various useful scripts.
* assets - Resources auto-generated by terraform itself e.g public/private ssh-keys.

#### ASUMPTIONS
The following S3 buckets need to exist before the telescope is launched
* cowrie-json-logs
* cowrie-malware-samples

The reason we do not provision these with Terraform is so as to avoid accidental deletion and dataloss when running **terraform destroy**
If you prefer to use different S3 bucket names, then all references to the above need to be manually updated. ```grep -r``` is your friend.


#### Basic usage
1. Update the EC2 Spot pricing by running ```bin/get-spot-prices.rb```
2. Launch honeypot with: 
```
terraform init
terraform apply --parallelism=10```

#### N.B N.B N.B
The ```terraform destroy``` command removes all resources. Including auto-generated SSH keys stored in the **assets** directory. If you happen to launch more instances using the same SSH key, you probably want to copy these somewhere safe.
